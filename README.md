# Project-0

Design files made to help disgram and plan the creation of a potential voice message system.
These design files include a use case diagram, four scenarios and four sequence diagrams detailing how the user will interact with the system in four different ways, and finally a class diagram which lays out the classes and their corresponding fields and methods.

This project was made by Tivis Hall and Xavier Markowitz.
